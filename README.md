# qwerty - AI Voice GPT with DALL·E
qwerty is a project that utilizes OpenAI's APIs to create a voice-based conversational interface powered by GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and generate images using DALL·E. This project allows users to input prompts in voice format and receive responses in voice format, as well as generate images from text prompts using DALL·E.

## Features
Voice-based Conversational Interface: Interact with the system using voice commands and receive responses in voice format generated by GPT.
GPT: Utilizes GPT for natural language understanding and generation.
DALL·E Image Generation: Generate images from textual prompts using DALL·E, an image generation model by OpenAI.
OpenAI API Integration: Integrates with OpenAI's APIs for GPT and DALL·E functionalities.

## Configuration
Before running the application, ensure you have obtained valid API keys from OpenAI for both GPT and DALL·E. Update the configuration files with these API keys for the application to function properly.

## Usage
Voice Prompt: Speak your prompt into the application's interface.

Generate Response: Receive the response generated by GPT in voice format.

Image Generation: Optionally, provide prompts for image generation using DALL·E and receive the generated images.
